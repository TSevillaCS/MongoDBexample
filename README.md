# MongoDBexample

This is an example of MongoDB.  To use MongoDB, you can start off creating a database.  From there, a database has collections.  Collections contain documents.

Documents have key value pairs.  The format used is JSON.

In this example, a collection is created, then data is inserted using JSON syntax.  Notice the difference between SQL and MongoDB, or NoSQL.

Also, data is quereied using the find() command.

MongoDB can be used through a user interface or through the MongoDB shell.
